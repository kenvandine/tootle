description: |
  Tootle is a client for the worldâ€™s largest free, open-source, decentralized
  microblogging network with real-time notifications and support for multiple
  accounts.

  Mastodon is lovingly crafted with power and speed in mind, resulting in a
  free, independent, and popular alternative to the centralized social
  networks.

  Anyone can run a Mastodon server. Each server hosts individual user accounts,
  the content they produce, and the content to which they are subscribed. Every
  user can follow each other and share their posts regardless of their server.
